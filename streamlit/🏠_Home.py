st.write("""
The urban transportation landscape is experiencing a significant transformation, driven by advancements in technology and data analytics. In this context, taxi services are seeking innovative solutions to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The Taxi Pickup Location Recommender System project is a pioneering initiative aimed at addressing one of the most pressing challenges faced by taxi drivers in Chicago: identifying the most probable locations for passenger pickups with minimal effort and time. This system leverages extensive data analysis and machine learning algorithms to recommend optimal pickup points, thereby streamlining the taxi service process and improving the overall experience for both drivers and passengers.

# Goal section
st.header("Goal")
st.write("""
Our primary goal is to harness data from various sources to empower taxi drivers with actionable insights that allow them to efficiently locate high-demand areas for passenger pickups. This, in turn, is expected to reduce idle time, lower fuel consumption, and increase the profitability of their operations. The recommender system utilizes the Nearest Neighbors algorithm with a "Ball Tree" method to analyze current location and time data, providing drivers with a ranked list of the top five pickup locations based on proximity and historical trends.
